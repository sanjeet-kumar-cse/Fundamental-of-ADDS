# Case Study: Active Directory Domain Services Implementation, Trust Relationship Creation, and Integration with Entra ID

## Background
A mid-sized enterprise, TechSolutions Inc., has recently undergone expansion, necessitating the integration of a new branch office into its IT infrastructure. The primary goal is to implement Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) at the new branch, establish a trust relationship with the existing corporate domain, and integrate the entire setup with Entra ID for seamless identity management.

## Objectives
1. Implement Active Directory Domain Services at the new branch.
2. Establish a trust relationship between the new branch domain and the existing corporate domain.
3. Integrate the AD DS with Entra ID to unify identity management across both domains.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Active Directory Domain Services Setup
- **Requirement Analysis:** Assess the requirements for domain controllers, network infrastructure, and security policies.
- **Installation:** Set up Windows Server 2022 at the new branch office. Install the Active Directory Domain Services role.
- **Domain Configuration:** Create a new domain (e.g., `branch.techsolutions.local`) and configure it as part of a new AD DS forest.

### 2. Trust Relationship Creation
- **Domain Preparation:** Ensure both the existing corporate domain (`corp.techsolutions.local`) and the new branch domain are properly configured.
- **Trust Establishment:** Using Active Directory Domains and Trusts, create a two-way trust relationship between `corp.techsolutions.local` and `branch.techsolutions.local`.
  - **Trust Type:** Set up as a forest trust for enhanced resource sharing.
  - **Trust Direction:** Configure both one-way and two-way trust settings as necessary for user and resource access.

### 3. Integration with Entra ID
- **Entra ID Preparation:** Ensure Entra ID is configured and ready for integration.
- **Azure AD Connect Installation:** Install and configure Azure AD Connect on a server in the corporate domain.
  - **Synchronization:** Configure synchronization for user accounts, groups, and organizational units between AD DS and Entra ID.
  - **Hybrid Identity:** Implement hybrid identity solutions to maintain a seamless sign-on experience for users.
- **Validation:** Verify that users from both domains can authenticate and access resources through Entra ID.

## Outcomes
1. **Seamless Integration:** Both domains function cohesively with shared resources and unified user management.
2. **Enhanced Security:** Improved security and access control through trust relationships and Entra ID integration.
3. **Operational Efficiency:** Streamlined user authentication and access management, enhancing productivity and reducing administrative overhead.

## Conclusion
The successful implementation of AD DS, trust relationships, and Entra ID integration provided TechSolutions Inc. with a robust, scalable, and efficient IT infrastructure, ensuring seamless operations across its expanded organizational footprint.
